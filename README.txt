The attached files should meet the assignment specifications
for Parts 1 to 3 of the assignment.  I did not have time to complete
Part 4.  Subequently, I have not attached a file called "diskput.c".

Parts 1 and 2 are self-explanatory.

For Part 3, the diskget program will the argument for the requested file is 
case-sensitive.  The program will read "ANS1.PDF" or "REMINDER.TXT".
However, the program will not read "ansi.pdf" or "Reminder.txt". 

The program prints out messages to the user when writing data.  Assuming
a valid file was requested and written properly, the user will receive
a message stating "Last cluster in file - exiting."  Otherwise, the user
will receive an error message.
